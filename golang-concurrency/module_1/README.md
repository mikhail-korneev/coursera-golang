## Mooreâ€™s law

Moore's law is predicted that transistor density would double every two years.

## Physical limitations

Physical limitations in devices that have stopped it from continuing to be true.

### Dynamic power

Transistors consume power when they switch; increasing transistor density leads to increasing power consumption, so power use has gotten high. It's critical for mobile devices that are widely used nowadays.

### Temperature

High power leads to high temperature. Chips are running at such high-power that they're heating up, and they need the cooling using some kind of cooling systems, which also have limitations, especially for consumer devices that use air-cooling. Without proper cooling the chip will melt.

### Voltage

Voltage should scale with transistor size, but it can't go too low because of transistor's threshold voltage. Transistor's threshold voltage is a voltage value below that transistors can't switch on.

### Noise

Noise problems with voltage, so it's difficult to determine high and low value for the small voltage swing.

### Leakage power

Transistor leaks off power even when it's not switching.
