# Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go

Coursera "Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go" assignments.

## Module 1: Bubble Sort

Write a Bubble Sort program in Go. The program should prompt the user to type in a sequence of up to 10 integers. The program should print the integers out on one line, in sorted order, from least to greatest. Use your favorite search tool to find a description of how the bubble sort algorithm works.

As part of this program, you should write a function called BubbleSort() which takes a slice of integers as an argument and returns nothing. The BubbleSort() function should modify the slice so that the elements are in sorted order.

A recurring operation in the bubble sort algorithm is the Swap operation which swaps the position of two adjacent elements in the slice. You should write a Swap() function which performs this operation. Your Swap() function should take two arguments, a slice of integers and an index value i which indicates a position in the slice. The Swap() function should return nothing, but it should swap the contents of the slice in position i with the contents in position i+1.

## Module 2: Displacement

Let us assume the following formula for displacement S as a function of time t, acceleration a, initial velocity Vo, and initial displacement So.

S =½ a*t^2 + Vo*t + So

Write a program which first prompts the user to enter values for acceleration, initial velocity, and initial displacement. Then the program should prompt the user to enter a value for time and the program should compute the displacement after the entered time.

You will need to define and use a function called GenDisplaceFn() which takes three float64 arguments, acceleration a, initial velocity vo, and initial displacement so. GenDisplaceFn() should return a function which computes displacement as a function of time, assuming the given values acceleration, initial velocity, and initial displacement. The function returned by GenDisplaceFn() should take one float64 argument t, representing time, and return one float64 argument which is the displacement travelled after time t.

For example, let’s say that I want to assume the following values for acceleration, initial velocity, and initial displacement: a = 10, Vo = 2, So = 1. I can use the following statement to call GenDisplaceFn() to generate a function fn which will compute displacement as a function of time.

fn := GenDisplaceFn(10, 2, 1)

Then I can use the following statement to print the displacement after 3 seconds.
fmt.Println(fn(3))

And I can use the following statement to print the displacement after 5 seconds.
fmt.Println(fn(5))

## Module 3: Animals v1

Write a program which allows the user to get information about a predefined set of animals. Three animals are predefined, cow, bird, and snake. Each animal can eat, move, and speak. The user can issue a request to find out one of three things about an animal: 1) the food that it eats, 2) its method of locomotion, and 3) the sound it makes when it speaks. The following table contains the three animals and their associated data which should be hard-coded into your program.

| Animal | Food eaten | Locomotion method | Spoken sound |
|--------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| cow    | grass      | walk              | moo          |
| bird   | worms      | fly               | peep         |
| snake  | mice       | slither           | hss          |

Your program should present the user with a prompt, ">", to indicate that the user can type a request. Your program accepts one request at a time from the user, prints out the answer to the request, and prints out a new prompt. Your program should continue in this loop forever. Every request from the user must be a single line containing 2 strings. The first string is the name of an animal, either "cow", "bird", or "snake". The second string is the name of the information requested about the animal, either "eat", "move", or "speak". Your program should process each request by printing out the requested data.

## Module 4: Animals v2

Write a program which allows the user to create a set of animals and to get information about those animals. Each animal has a name and can be either a cow, bird, or snake. With each command, the user can either create a new animal of one of the three types, or the user can request information about an animal that he/she has already created. Each animal has a unique name, defined by the user. Note that the user can define animals of a chosen type, but the types of animals are restricted to either cow, bird, or snake. The following table contains the three types of animals and their associated data.

| Animal | Food eaten | Locomotion method | Spoken sound |
|--------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| cow    | grass      | walk              | moo          |
| bird   | worms      | fly               | peep         |
| snake  | mice       | slither           | hss          |

Your program should present the user with a prompt, ">", to indicate that the user can type a request. Your program should accept one command at a time from the user, print out a response, and print out a new prompt on a new line. Your program should continue in this loop forever. Every command from the user must be either a "newanimal" command or a "query" command.

Each "newanimal" command must be a single line containing three strings. The first string is "newanimal". The second string is an arbitrary string which will be the name of the new animal. The third string is the type of the new animal, either "cow", "bird", or "snake". Your program should process each newanimal command by creating the new animal and printing "Created it!" on the screen.

Each “query” command must be a single line containing 3 strings. The first string is "query". The second string is the name of the animal. The third string is the name of the information requested about the animal, either "eat", "move", or "speak". Your program should process each query command by printing out the requested data.

Define an interface type called  "Animal"  which describes the methods of an animal. Specifically, the "Animal" interface should contain the methods "Eat()", "Move()", and "Speak()", which take no arguments and return no values. The "Eat()" method should print the animal’s food, the "Move()" method should print the animal’s locomotion, and the "Speak()" method should print the animal’s spoken sound. Define three types "Cow",  "Bird", and "Snake". For each of these three types, define methods "Eat()", "Move()", and "Speak()" so that the types  "Cow", "Bird", and "Snake" all satisfy the "Animal" interface. When the user creates an animal, create an object of the appropriate type. Your program should call the appropriate method when the user issues a query command.
